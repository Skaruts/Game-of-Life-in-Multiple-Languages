# Game-of-Life-in-Multiple-Languages
I always make a Game of Life when lerning a new language or framework, and since over the years I've jumped around between languages and frameworks/engines, eventually I ended up with a whole bunch of Games of Life made in a variety of languages and frameworks. 

I'm gathering them in this repo, as I clean them up in my spare time.
