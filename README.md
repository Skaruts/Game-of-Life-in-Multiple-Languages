# Game-of-Life-in-Multiple-Languages
I always make a Game of Life when learning a new language or framework, and since over the years I've jumped around between quite a few of them, eventually I ended up with a bunch of Games of Life made in a variety of languages and frameworks. 

I'm gathering them in this repo, as I clean them up in my spare time.

The [C++](./C++)/[Nim](./Nim)/[PySFML](./Python/PySFML) versions are just a bare bones GoL. 

The [TIC-80](./Lua/TIC-80) (lua) version is a more intricate one. 

The [LOVE2D](./Lua/LÃ–VE2D/) version is bare bones, but I could swear I had one with some of the same fun stuff from the TIC-80 version. Will add it here if I can dig it up.

All of them use the same generation algorithm, which is the fastest I could come up with so far. Maybe one day I'll manage to wrap my head around [Tony Finch's algorithms](https://dotat.at/prog/life/life.html) or even hashlife, but for now this is the best I got. And I'm not unhappy with its performance. 

All versions have a scalar variable 'm' that can be changed to make the cells smaller: m=1 makes cells of 16x16 px in a 80x50 grid, and m=16 makes cells of 1px in a 1280x800 grid.

Cpp/Nim versions give me ~20fps with m=1, and ~60-70fps with m=8.

LOVE2D gives me ~30fps with m=8.

PySFML gives me ~60-70 with... m=1... (either I did something wrong or...)

TIC-80 can't have a very large grid (240x136) and is by design slower, and gives me ~20fps with m=1 (8px cells, in this case).
