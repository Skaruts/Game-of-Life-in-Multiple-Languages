# Game-of-Life-in-Multiple-Languages
I always make a Game of Life when learning a new language or framework, and since over the years I've jumped around between quite a few of them, eventually I ended up with a bunch of Games of Life made in a variety of languages and frameworks. 

I'm gathering them in this repo, as I clean them up in my spare time.
