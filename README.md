# Game-of-Life-in-Multiple-Languages
I always make a Game of Life when learning a new language or framework, and since over the years I've jumped around between quite a few of them, eventually I ended up with a bunch of Games of Life made in a variety of languages and frameworks. 

I'm gathering them in this repo, as I clean them up in my spare time.

The C++/Nim/PySFML versions are just a bare bones GoL. 

The TIC-80 (lua) version is a more intricate one. 

The LOVE2D version is bare bones, but I could swear I had one with some of the same fun stuff from the TIC-80 version. Will add it here if I can dig it up.
