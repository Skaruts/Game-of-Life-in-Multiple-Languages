This project was made in [TIC-80](https://tic.computer) tiny computer, and is available to play online or for download [at the TIC-80 website](https://tic.computer/play?cart=753), and also [on itch.io](https://metaldudebro.itch.io/tiny-life). Due to the free version having a character limit the code is shortened, and perhaps a bit cryptic.

This is by far the most complete Game of Life I've made so far, with a UI, drawing tools, cell counts, help screens, and all that good stuff.
